# IMDB-Reviews-classification-using-NLP-and-Big-Data
## This is a personal project to help build an API for automatic rating of movie reviews based on texts written by users.
This project aims to classify feelings in movie reviews in the IMDB database. A GRU-type recurrent neural network (RNN) was trained to automatically classify reviews as positive or negative.  
The algorithm was written in Python, using the PySpark library to read and organize the data. The keras, sklearn, numpy, pandas, nltk and a few other libraries were used in creating and training the model.
